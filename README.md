# Cyberbullying Detector
This application takes a piece of text (that a User submits), and uses Machine Learning to determine if the piece of text is cyberbullying or not. The machine learning model was developed in scikit-learn using data from various sources such as Formspring.

This was my final project for CSc 59929 - Introduction to Machine Learning at the City College of New York, taught by Professor Erik Grimmelmann.
